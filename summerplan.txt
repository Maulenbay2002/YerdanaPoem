Here is my plan for this summer

I am going to learn the GUI in Java, especially Swing and JavaFX

I am gong to use the knowledge in OOP to complete the professor's project

Actually I am going to work part time job 

Also, I have to start freelancing on upwork and fiverr

This is to ensure that I will become self-sufficien by the end of my 2nd year at UBC

So that I can live in Vancouver during summer while working remotely

I am going to take DSA course with nfactorial school
